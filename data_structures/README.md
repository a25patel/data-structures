# Let's Practice: Accessing Complex Data Structures

Below are many situations where you might need to manipulate nested objects and arrays. Accessing deeply nested objects and arrays is very common in Web Development, because data is often carried in a format called **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation. Because of this, you'll often have to access objects within arrays within other objects, et cetera.


### Strings
- [String Manipulation 1](strings_1.md)
- [String Manipulation 2](strings_2.md)

### Arrays
- [Arrays 1](arrays_1.md)
- [Arrays 2](arrays_2.md)

### Objects
- [Objects 1](objects_1.md)
- [Objects 2](objects_2.md)

### JSON
- [JSON 1](json_1.md)
- [JSON 2](json_2.md)
