# Let's Practice: Accessing Complex Data Structures

Below are many situations where you might need to manipulate nested objects and arrays. Accessing deeply nested objects and arrays is very common in Web Development, because data is often carried in a format called **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation.

### !challenge

* type: code-snippet
* language: javascript
* id: 3b5ccc12-9f00-4b2d-b987-b0509611d0e5
* title: Array Access

### !question

**Using the following array:**

```
var books = ["The Hobbit", "A Brief History of Time", "The Universe in a Nutshell", "Teach Like A Champion"];
```

Write create a variable that outputs the following:

* `"The Hobbit"` in a variable called `hobbit`

* `"The Universe in a Nutshell"` in a variable called `universe`

### !placeholder

var books = ["The Hobbit", "A Brief History of Time", "The Universe in a Nutshell", "Teach Like A Champion"];

var hobbit = null;
var universe = null;

### !tests

```js
describe('array access', function() {

    it("has a hobbit variable", function() {
      expect(hobbit, "value is incorrect").to.eq("The Hobbit")
    });

    it("has a universe variable", function() {
      expect(universe, "value is incorrect").to.eq("The Universe in a Nutshell")
    });

})
```
