#### Code Points
> ðŸŒŸ Elective Content - The content in this section will help you understand how Strings are actually just sequences of Numbers, and what that means.

In JavaScript, strings are sequences of numbers. How do we know what number translates to what character? There's a name for the scheme we use, called  [**UTF-16**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16). UTF ([Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) Transformation Format) is what is known as a **Character Encoding**, which is a fancy name for "the agreement as to which numbers mean what characters".

There's a lot of interesting history as to how this came to be, which you can find in the wikipedia article above. The key takeaway is this:


[`String.fromCodePoint()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCodePoint) - the way to get a string from a series of numbers OR **Unicode Code Points**.

This method is a  _static method_ of the String class. That means you always call them like `String.fromCodePoint()`, rather than `"foo".fromCodePoint()`, which will fail.

[`str.codePointAt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/codePointAt) - the way to get a code point at a given position in a string.

This method is an _instance method_ of the String class. That means you call it on the instance, `"foo".codePointAt(1)` rather than `String.codePointAt(1)`.

Why might we want to convert from characters to code points? There are many reasons, but one that you might consider immediately useful is this: Numbers are much simpler to do math with than strings.

Let's look at an example:

```js

function fragileEncrypt(str) {
  let newStr = '';
  for (var c in str) {
    newStr += String.fromCodePoint(str.codePointAt(c) + 5);
  }
  return newStr;
}

function fragileDecrypt(str) {
  let newStr = '';
  for (var c in str) {
    newStr += String.fromCodePoint(str.codePointAt(c) - 5);
  }
  return newStr;
}

console.log(fragileEncrypt('abcd')); // ==> 'fghi'
console.log(fragileDecrypt(fragileEncrypt('abcd'))); // ==> 'abcd'

```

`fragileEncrypt` takes in a string, converts each character to a code point, does a reversible operation on it, and then returns the string. `fragileDecrypt` does the opposite. This encryption scheme is pretty simple to break, but it is one of the earliest known methods of encrypting messages, because you can do it by hand.


### !question

Given a string, write a function called `simpleEncrypt` that performs a complex, reversible operation on a string that isn't a single operation (not just `+` or `-` or `*` or `/` alone, use more than one step). Then write a function called `simpleDecrypt` that reverses it.

### !question

One of the most common things you'll have to write a quick function for is parsing a query string. Every web developer should know how to do this.
Given a string that's formatted like so: `?first_name=Grace&last_name=Hopper`
Output an object formatted like so:
```js
{
  "first_name" : "Grace",
  "last_name" : "Hopper"
}
```
### !question

One of the final tasks a master string-parser can do is parse a common format called Comma Separated Values, or CSV files. Any spreadsheet can be exported to CSV, so it's a popular format for transferring data between people who use spreadsheets and people who use databases.

Given a (possibly very long) string formatted like the example below, return an object. The keys of the object should be the values from first line of the string. You'll find a line break character (`/n`) in between lines. The values should be all the data from the column the first row is aligned with.

```
id, Product, Price, Markup, Quantity
1, "Red T-Shirt", 10, 20, 5
2, "Blue T-Shirt", 10, 20, 8
3, "Green T-Shirt", 10, 15, 15
4, "Yellow T-Shirt", 10, 20, 3
```

Should produce:

```js
{
  "id" : [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "Product" : ["Red T-Shirt", "Blue T-Shirt", "Green T-Shirt", "Yellow T-Shirt"],
  "Price" : [20, 20, 15, 20],
  "Markup" : [10, 10, 10, 10],
  "Quantity" : [5, 8, 15, 3]
}
```

Given an empty string, return an empty object.

#### Regular Expressions

> ðŸ¤“ðŸŒŸ This is definitely Elective Content - come back to this space when you feel like a real JavaScript hot shot!

Regular expressions are like a mini-language in JavaScript. When you find strings formatted in a particular way, sometimes it's a good idea to use Regular Expressions to simplify testing if a string is in a given format. That said, Regular Expressions can quickly become difficult to parse and read, so be careful when choosing to use them.

Let's look at a _simple_ regex first. The `str.match()` method is the method we use to test whether our string matches a Regular Expression.

```js
text.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.?[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)+/g)
```

This Regular Expression tests to see if the string is a valid Email. It's fairly naive, but it will generally match `foo@demo.net` and `bar.ba@test.co.uk`, which covers most email addresses. Let's break down the pieces and build up our own regex. Open [RegExr.com](http://regexr.com/) in another browser window. Open it alongside this window. This tool allows you to write a few test cases in the bottom area, and then compose a regex expression that will light up parts of the text that match when you use it. It has a really amazing reference section, and a cheatsheet as well. There are copious examples listed under the Help and Community tabs, which are great starting off points.

```js
text.match(/some regex/)
```
This part is the method on the string that does the checking. You'll notice rather than passing in something with a string, we use two slashes: `//`. In Regexr, we won't have to write the part that says `text.match`, as this tool is really only about building the expression that goes between the `//`.

```js
/[a-zA-Z0-9]/g
```
Copy and paste this code into Regexr and see what gets highlighted out of the example text.

The first thing to notice at the end is called a _Flag_, which consists of everything after the last `/`. In this case, we have the letter `g`, which means "do a search and match every part of the string, not just the first part you find that matches"

The square brackets are what is called a "character set" - what that means is anything inside of the square brackets `[]` is interpreted as a potential range of characters. `a-zA-Z0-9` means any character between little `a` and little `z`, or capital `A` and capital `Z`, or the characters from `0` to `9`. This really just means any letter or any number but not any special characters. In the Reference section of Regexr, the Character Classes section has more on character sets.

```js
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g
```
The plus sign after the group of characters means "one or more of the preceding token" - which means there has to be at least 1 alphanumeric character. The word _token_ here refers to "some kind of definition of what character or set of characters this can be". Notice what happens as we add the `+` sign. In the Reference section of Regexr, the Quantifiers and Alternation section shows other ways to quantify - experiment to see what happens: remove the `g` from the end, take note what changes. Change the plus to a `.` or a `*`, and take note of how the highlights change.

```js
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.?/g
```

To continue building up our expression, we've added some characters after the `+`. `\` is a character that typically means "escape", or "don't interpret as code, interpret literally". So, `\.` means "an actual dot". The `?` is another _quantifier_, it means "0 or 1"- essentially it means the character may or may not be there.

Currently, our expression can match any number of alphanumeric characters followed by a dot, or no dot. `this.` and `this` and `evenThis.` would match our regex.

```js
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.?[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g
```

You can see the next bit is just another token like the first one- any alphanumeric character. We can match any emails formatted like `firstname.lastname` with this. Next, we'll need to look for an `@` sign. The rules for an email address mean there is only one `@` sign in the whole thing, no quantifier needed. It has to be an `@` sign only, no other possibilities exist for what can come in between the name and the domain, so we can simply put a literal `@` sign right after the tokens we have before.

```js
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.?[a-zA-Z0-9]+@/g
```

The `+` sign before the `@` simply refers to the range before it, and so it's not related to the `@` sign.  

Let's look at the rest of the expression:

```js
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.?[a-zA-Z0-9]+@[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)+/g
```

After the `@` sign, we might have a couple of dots- any number of them really. In between the dots there will be alphanumeric characters, but we don't know how many sets of "dots and alphanumeric characters" there will be. For this, we need a "group", which takes a set of characters or character sets that occur together and considers them as a single token. `foo.co.uk` is one set of "some number of alphanumeric characters" `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` followed by two sets of "a literal dot followed by some number of alphanumeric characters" `(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)+`. Because the set of parenthesis, the expression "a literal dot followed by some number of alphanumeric characters" becomes a _token_ which can be used with a quantifier, `+` (meaning 1 or more).

This expression doesn't cover email addresses like `lizardbot_2000@hotmail.com` or `themillerfamily+kids-soccer@gmail.com`, because it doesn't account for underscores or `+` signs, so this regex is fairly simple. We could simplify it further, which is an exercise left for you to do on your own, with the help of [Regexr](http://regexr.com/).

### Template Strings

New in ES6: Template Strings!  
Template Strings are a way we can write a string that has lots of variables, without lots of ugly string concatenation.

Template strings look like this:

```js
var name = "Mike D";
var something = "money";
var paulRevere = `The kid said "get ready, cuz this ain't funny, my name's ${name} and I'm about to get ${something}."`
```

As you can see, template strings are defined with backticks (same key as the `~` key) and replace any valid JavaScript expression inside of `${}` with it's string representation.

### !question

Due to budget cuts, we'll need to cut back on the days of Christmas in this song.
Use a template string to produce the new song given the number of days as a number.

`daysOfChristmas(5)` should produce the following string:
```
On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree
On the 2nd day of Christmas my true love gave to me, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the 3rd day of Christmas my true love gave to me, three french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the 4th day of Christmas my true love gave to me, four calling birds three french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me, five golden rings four calling birds three french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
```

- Include line breaks with `\n`
- Don't repeat yourself!
- We'll only test up to `5`
- If no argument or `0` is given, return `"I got coal for Christmas"`
