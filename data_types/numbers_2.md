## Swamp Things

Your task in this challenge is to determine how populations of swamp creatures change over time.

You are given several variables representing populations of different creatures in a swamp.

* Each üêä Croc eats 20 fish a month, 1 snake a week and 1 bird a week
* Each üêç Snake eats 1 bird a week
* Each ü¶Ü Bird eats 2 fish a day
* üêü Fish are herbivorous and feed on sea grass and algae (which you are not keeping track of)

If there is not enough food to feed a creature, remove it from the population (it starves üò®)

* Fish reproduce once a month, for every 2 fish there are 100 new fish
* Birds reproduce once a month, for every 2 birds there are 5 new birds
* Crocs reproduce once a year (in June), for every 2 crocs there are 5 new crocs
* Snakes reproduce twice a year (in March and in September), for every 2 snakes there are 10 new snakes


Your task is to find out the following information:
* How many fish are there at the _end of_ March, and September? Create a variable for this, call it `marchFish` and `septFish`
* How many snakes are there next January? Create a variable for this, call it `snakesAt1Year`
* Bonus: Will birds go extinct in the next 500 years? If so, how many months will it take? Create a variable called `birdExtinction`, set it to `null` if it won't ever happen.

You can assume the following things:
* January 1st is the start date.
* Time moves along 1 month at a time (to keep things simple)
	* There are 4 weeks in every month
	* There are 28 days a month (4 * 7)
* There 12 months in a year
* Creatures eat before they reproduce
	* Crocs eat first.
		* They Eat Fish first (If there are not enough, some crocs die...)
		* Then they eat Snakes (If there are not enough, some crocs die...)
		* Then they eat Birds (If there are not enough, some crocs die...)
	* Snakes eat second. (If there are not enough birds, some snakes die...)
	* Birds eat last. (If there are not enough fish, some birds die...)
* Every reproduction event happens after the creatures eat on the first day of the month, all at once

Tips:
* Start by looking at the problem, what do you need to know, and what information do you have?
* Iterate towards a solution. Start by solving smaller problems that make up the larger problem.
* If you find yourself repeating the same operations over and over, try using a loop!
* Don't forget about the `%` operator and the `+=` operator
