### Getting Started

These exercises will help you get started writing Javascript Expressions.

Open the file `exercises.js` #TODO list files in your IDE. There are several places for you to write expressions, marked with numbers. They're contained inside of functions, which are used by the **automated tests** that will run your code and validate that they are correct. If you aren't familiar with **Functions** yet, don't worry. Just make sure to _keep your code inside the curly braces_.

### Checking Your Work

We can be sure your code is working because we have written other code that's capable of running and validating your code. To do this, type `open index.html` in your terminal, from this folder.
