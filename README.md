# JavaScript Drills

Test-driven code challenges and Assessments to support the JavaScript Curriculum!

These exercises contain JavaScript Language drills. For exercises and assessments related to the browser and the Document Object Model, see [Browser DOM Drills](https://github.com/gSchool/browser-dom-drills).

### How to use these exercises

1. Do Challenges for Component Skills until you feel you've mastered the material. Challenges are for practice, so don't feel the need to do all of them.
2. Once you feel up to it (or when your instructor tells you), do the assessments. They'll signal to your instructor that you're ready to move on.

## Challenges

Challenges allow you to practice the concepts you're learning before taking an assessment to prove you know it.
