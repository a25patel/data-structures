# JavaScript Drills

Test-driven code challenges and Assessments to support the JavaScript Curriculum!

These exercises contain JavaScript Language drills. For exercises and assessments related to the browser and the Document Object Model, see [Browser DOM Drills](https://github.com/gSchool/browser-dom-drills).

### How to use this repository

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
1. Clone your copy of the repository to your development environment.
1. **Branch** out each time you start on a new standard. `git checkout -b js-expressions` is an example of how to do that.
1. Keep all work related to that standard on your branch named after what you're working on.

## Challenges

Challenges allow you to practice the concepts you're learning before taking an assessment to prove you know it.

**[Write and Evaluate JS Expressions](./js-expressions/README.md)**  

Operators, String concatenation, Math, Precedence / Parenthesis, Prefix / Postfix notation for integers, Variables, Literals.

**[Organize Code with Functions](./functions/README.md)**
Function syntax, Return values, Scope, References.

<!--
**[Use conditionals and loops to control the flow of a program (W0099)](./js-conditionals-loops/README.md)**

`if/if else/else` statements, `while` loops, `for` loops, Iterate through arrays, Iterate through objects.

**[Organize code with functions (W0003)](./js-functions/README.md)**

Use functions to organize code, use return values to move data between execution contexts, use functions to mutate the state of objects
**[Solve problems with accumulator patterns (W0004)](./js-accumulators/README.md)**
**[Describe how key parts of JavaScript work (W0006)](./js-describe/README.md)**
**[Create objects using constructor functions (W0058)](./js-constructor/README.md)**
**[Mentally evaluate code examples using state and behavior (W0057)](./js-evaluate-state-and-behavior/README.md)**
**[Model objects with state and behavior (W0054)](./js-model-state-and-behavior/README.md)**
**[Define and call functions that have variable parameters (W0022)](./js-functions-variable-parameters/README.md)**
**[Refactor loops to use functional style (W0063)](./js-functional-loops/README.md)** -->
