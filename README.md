# JavaScript Drills

Test-driven code challenges and Assessments to support the JavaScript Curriculum!

## Challenges

Challenges allow you to practice the concepts you're learning before taking an assessment to prove you know it.

**[Write and Evaluate JS Expressions](./js-expressions/README.md)**  

Operators, String concatenation, Math, Precedence / Parenthesis, Prefix / Postfix notation for integers, Variables, Literals

**[Use conditionals and loops to control the flow of a program (W0099)](./js-conditionals-loops/README.md)**

if/if else/else statements, while loops, for loops, iterate through arrays, iterate through objects

**[Organize code with functions (W0003)](./js-functions/README.md)**
**[Solve problems with accumulator patterns (W0004)](./js-accumulators/README.md)**
**[Describe how key parts of JavaScript work (W0006)](./js-describe/README.md)**
**[Create objects using constructor functions (W0058)](./js-constructor/README.md)**
**[Mentally evaluate code examples using state and behavior (W0057)](./js-evaluate-state-and-behavior/README.md)**
**[Model objects with state and behavior (W0054)](./js-model-state-and-behavior/README.md)**
**[Define and call functions that have variable parameters (W0022)](./js-functions-variable-parameters/README.md)**
**[Refactor loops to use functional style (W0063)](./js-functional-loops/README.md)**



## Assessments
