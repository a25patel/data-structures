### !question

Choose between `var`, `let` and `const` to create these variables.

- Store the number `20` in `bikes`
- Store the number `50` in `cars`
- Store the number `20` in `vans`
- Store the number `200` in `riders`
- Store the number `30` in `drivers`
- Store the number `5` in `carCapacity`
- Store the number `8` in `vanCapacity`
- Store the number `30` in `carMPG`
- Store the number `20` in `vanMPG`

### !end-question

### !placeholder

// Do we have enough space for all the riders and drivers in cars?
haveRiderCarCapacity = null;

// Do we have enough space for all the riders and drivers in vans?
haveRiderVanCapacity = null;

// Do we have enough space for all the riders if each car has to have one driver?
haveEnoughCarDrivers = null;

// Do we have enough space for all the riders if we used vans instead of cars?
haveEnoughVanDrivers = null;

// If we have to travel 100 miles, will cars use more gas than vans? (assuming we have as many cars or vans and drivers as we would need)
carsMoreThanVans = null;

### !question

Choose between `var`, `let` and `const` to create a variable called `coolBears`, which we'll update several times in a loop.

By the end, the string should read "paddington bear is a pretty cool bear, smokey bear is a pretty cool bear, etc", with every bear represented, proclaiming it's coolness.

### !end-question

const bears = ['paddington', 'smokey', 'yogi', 'teddy', 'black', 'brown', 'polar', 'panda']
// create coolBears here


for (let i = 0; i<bears.length; i++) {
  coolBears += bears[i];
}

    it("has a variable called coolBears with all the bears, letting them know how cool they are", function() {
      expect(coolBears, "Default value is incorrect").to.eq(['paddington', 'smokey', 'yogi', 'teddy', 'black', 'brown', 'polar', 'panda'].join(" is a pretty cool bear, ") + " is a pretty cool bear")

### !question

Using a single numerical variable in a loop, choose between `var`, `let` and `const`, for the variables below, then `console.log` this classic song:
```
On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree.
On the 2nd day of Christmas my true love gave to me, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
On the 3rd day of Christmas my true love gave to me, three french hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
On the 4th day of Christmas my true love gave to me, four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me, five golden rings! four calling birds, three french hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
