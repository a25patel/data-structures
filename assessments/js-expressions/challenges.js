// Standard - W0002 - Write and Evaluate JavaScript Expressions

//#Success Criteria - Dimension Variables with `var`, `let`, `const`

//##Challenge 1
// Create a variable called bikes, store the number 20 in bikes

//##Challenge 2
// Create a variable that will not change, called MAX_CONNECTIONS

//##Challenge 3
// Create a variable called i for the purpose of counting loop iterations, that we won't use again after the loop (don't write the loop)

//##Challenge 4
// Create a variable called totalBears, which we'll update any time we create a new bear.

//##Challenge 1
// Your local swamp has wildlife population estimates. We want to know several pieces of information.
// Some information about the local ecosystem:
// Birds and Crocs eat fish. Birds eat 1 fish a day, while crocs eat 5.
// Snakes eat Birds, 1 a day.
// If a creature does not eat for a day, it dies.
// For every 2 fish, 10 fish are born every 7 days.
// For every 2 birds, 5 birds are born every 7 days.
// For every 2 snakes, 2 snakes are born every 7 days.
// Crocs take a long time to reproduce so their population remains stable.
