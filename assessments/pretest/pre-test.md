This challenge will help you understand if you're ready to take the final technical assessment!

* title: Application Prep Pretest

### !question

Write a function called `filterMembers` that takes two inputs:
* `filter`, an array to filter
* `exclude`, an array of elements to filter out

It should return the `filter` array, without any members from `exclude`. The elements should remain in the order they're in to start. It should return whatever is left the `filter` array regardless of the content.

Examples:
- `filterMembers([1,2,3,4,5,6],[3,6])` should return `[1,2,4,5]`
- `filterMembers(["cats", "dogs", "birds", "squirrels"],["birds", "squirrels"])` should return `["cats", "dogs"]`
- `filterMembers(["1", 1, "2", 2],[1,2])` should return `["1", "2"]`
- `filterMembers([1,2,3,4,5,6])` should return `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

    })

    it("Compares type properly", function() {
      expect(filterMembers(["1", 1, "2", 2],[1,2])).to.include.members(["1", "2"])
      expect(filterMembers(["1", 1, "2", 2],[1,2])).to.not.include.members([1,2])
    })

    it("returns the first array when given an empty array or undefined to filter out", function() {
      expect(filterMembers([1,2,3,4,5,6])).to.include.members([1,2,3,4,5,6])
      expect(filterMembers([1,2,3,4,5,6],[])).to.include.members([1,2,3,4,5,6])

# How did you do?

## ðŸ˜± Help!  I didn't even know where to get started!

That's OK!  We got you ðŸ˜€

Your best next step is to go to [Unit 2](https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-curriculum/blob/precourse/10_Syntax/README.md) to learn JavaScript!

## ðŸ¤” Phew!  That was rough, but I did it

Maybe brush up on your programming fundamentals.

Go to [Unit 4 - Intro to Programming](https://github.com/gSchool/wdi-application-prep/blob/master/units/programming.md)

## ðŸ˜´ Psshhhhh.... piece of cake!

Awesome!  You are probably ready to Enroll!

Go ahead and take the [final technical assessment](https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-drills/blob/master/assessments/pretest/post-test.md)!
