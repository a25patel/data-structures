# Checkpoint: Create Objects with State and Behavior

This checkpoint tells us you can Create Classes with Attributes and Methods to Model Objects with State and Behavior in JavaScript.

#### Cheatsheet

Make a new Class:
```javascript
var Classname = function(){};
```

Make a Method:
```javascript
Classname.prototype.methodName = function() {};
```

### !question

### The Cat
_Write yourself a virtual cat - animals with a CLI are so much nicer than ones with fur._

*   Create a class that represents a Cat. It should have properties for `tiredness`, `hunger`, `loneliness` and `happiness`
*   Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. Name them `feed`, `sleep`, and `pet`
*   Make the methods take **arguments** that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts set by given **parameters**
*   Write a method that returns the cat's overall status formatted like this:
```
Tiredness: 10
Hunger: 5
Loneliness: 3
Happiness: 12
```
* ðŸŒŸ Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - sometimes make it so the cat doesn't _want_ to be petted. Check out `Math.random()`! Then, write a test that runs the `pet()` method a few times to make sure that your cat will sometimes reject being petted.
